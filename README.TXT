# Memory Matching
A text-based memory match game.  It was the largest program I had written so far at the time while learning to program in high school, at ~600 lines long.  It takes in user input by asking for 1 number at a time through a pop-up panel.  This was a good experience to learn about JOptionPane and formatting text output nicely.
